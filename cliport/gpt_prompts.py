    "The basic low-level executable instruction is only in the format of "

    "They are (1) the vanilla pick-and-place, such as "
    "'Pick up the yellow block and place it on the red block.',"
    "'Pick up the yellow block and place it on the blue zone.'; "
    "(2) the pick-and-place with size option, such as "
    "'Pick up the smaller blue block and place it on the bigger red block.'; "
    "(3) the pick-and-place with area option, such as "
    "'Pick up the blue block on the top left area and place it on the left bottom area.' "
    "All you plans should follow the format of one of the three low-level instructions."

    "based on the current observation before planning for the next step. "
    "Note that you only need to output the plan for the next step each time "
    "rather than plans for all steps."
